    - user object that hashes passwords and stores all the things as well as session database using user email to pull from session


### Next Steps

- This gets rid of unneccesary and messy files

#### Path Two
- migrate to sql database
    - learn sql database

#### Path Three
- better organization that doesn't spread behaviors as much
    - methods
    - routes
    - templates
